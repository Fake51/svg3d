Making 3D graphics with Javascript and SVG.

The code is currently very simple - you first run initDom() on the module, then you can modify rotation angles afterwards and call updatePolygons() to have the svg elements updated.

There's obviously a lot of work left in making this proper - it needs to be modular and optimized. Then again, it's just a PoC as well as a learning project, so it might just stay in this form unless I need it for something else.

Not to mention that there are actual 3D graphics libraries out there that one should use if there's a need :)
